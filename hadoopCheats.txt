Useful Hadoop commands and troubleshooting tricks

Compiled from Udacity's course #ud617: (Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce)

Can test mappers and reducers on a small test data as follows:

$head -50 ../data/purchases.txt > testfile

$cat testfile | ./mapper.py (testing the mapper)

$cat testfile | ./mapper.py | sort | ./reducer.py (testing the entire pipeline)

To put the purchases.txt file on the hadoop system in a directory called myInput do
$hadoop fs -put ../data/purchases.txt myInput

To run MapReduce on HDFS on the virtual machine:
$hs mapper.py reducer.py myInput myOutput

hs is the alias used for the clumpsy hadoop jar command on the virtual machince. 

To look at the output of the MapReduce:  
$hadoop fs -cat myOutput/part-00000
